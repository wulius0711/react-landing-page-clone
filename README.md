# react-landing-page-clone

Implement landing page with React, CSS Modules and SCSS.

Rebuild it in React (looking at the code as little as possible).

## TODO

- [ ] Choose a landing page from [Landingfolio](https://www.landingfolio.com/)
- [ ] Copy all elements of the landing page
- [ ] Style the elements

## Stretch TODOs

- [ ] Copy animations and videos
- [ ] Copy interactive parts of the website
- [ ] Right after [creating your first (empty) Git commit](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-command-line/#5-create-and-push-an-initial-commit), create a new branch. Use this branch to [open a pull request on GitHub](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-git-github/#opening-pull-requests)
